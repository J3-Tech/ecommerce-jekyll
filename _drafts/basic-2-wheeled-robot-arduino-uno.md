###Mission:###  
Create a simple 2 wheeled robot using the arduino uno

###Project Summary:###
In this project I am creating a mobile robot platform that can be used as a test platform for later mobile robotics projects of mine. I just want a basic, simple, mobile robot. The brains of this little robot will be the Arduino UNO, and the bot will be driven by 2 continuous rotation servos (since I have them on hand, and there's no need to go the DC motor route).

###Start Date:###
Project Started in August 2014.

###The Plan (the simple version):###
1. Get the needed parts
2. Put the parts together
3. write some test software
4. test it and make sure it works!


###Parts:###
*  Arduino Uno
*  2 Continuous Rotation Servos (parallax brand, courtesy of an old BOE Bot kit)
*  Metal Frame
*  2 Plastic wheels
*  1 Castor wheel
*  Jumper Wire
*  XX volt battery pack

The nice part about this project is I am salvaging a number of parts from a BOE Bot kit that I had gotten years ago for working with the BASIC Stamp. The parts I am salvaging are the frame, wheels, and servos. If you want to make this same bot at home you will need to make your own frame, use a continuous rotation servo (they do not come this way by default, you have to get'em special), and some plastic wheels/castor. Pretty much any frame and wheels will do, but the special servo is important.

##Final Result##
..stay tuned.. this project still underway
