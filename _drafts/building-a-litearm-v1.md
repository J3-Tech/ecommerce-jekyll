This post is part one in a series documenting my experience building my first LiteArm. In this post I will discuss making the liteArm parts myself with my 3D printer and lessons learned doing this first run of parts.

If you are not familiar with the LiteArm then you should start with [this project page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.nav.projects_link }}litearm). Essentially, the LiteArm is an open-source, desktop sized robotic arm.

So, back to the pont of this post.

If you are planning on printing your own set of parts for the litearm kit then you may want to know the following before you get started:
> 1. Some of the parts are going to take a long time to print. A long time.  
For example, the first part I printed was the improved i2 base, labeled part #1. That single piece took nearly 6 hours to print. That was the most time intensive piece. Most pieces can be printed in or around an hour or 2. (Assuming moderate speed and layer height)

>2. Some of the parts are import
