If you've printed with PLA, my guess is you have also dealt with heat creep and the extruder jams that come with it. If you are not familiar with the phrase 'heat creep' then you may want to read this post first - [common problems printing with PLA]({% post_url 2014-09-12-common-problems-3d-printing-with-pla %}).

Here are my tips and tricks for unclogging your PLA Extruder jams.

##1. If you catch the clog when it first happens, you can prevent the really bad jams. ##  
If you hear a clicking coming from the tool head, followed by a grinding sound from the hobbed bolt area, then you can be pretty sure you've got a jam. If you pull out the filament while the extruder is still hot, and jam is new, then it won't have had time to warp so much. In my experience, if you can yank out a jam right when it happens then you can clean up the hobbed bolt and be back to printing in minutes. Saving you potentially hours of frustrating extruder tinkering.  

##2. If you didn't catch it right away, remember to bring the extruder up to temperature before trying to pull the filament ##  
Pulling too hard when it isn't hot could lead to breaking something. Either that, or it just won't go anywhere.  

##3. Make sure to clean out the hobbed bolt.##  
It will likely be filled with filament, and will require careful picking to be cleaned out. Try note to damage the threads of the bolt while doing so. In my experience, you will need to use a stainless steel pick (like the dental kind) to really get the gunk out of there. If you don't clean it, then you will notice right away the filament isn't getting 'pushed' down the extruder as well.

Here is what it looks like when the hobbed bolt get's full of filament (Here the filament was black, but it kind of looks greyish when gunked up in the threads of the bolt)<br /><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/126939770@N02/15096413028" title="hobbed-bolt-full-of-filament by Joe Norton, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5583/15096413028_7ed4318c78_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="hobbed-bolt-full-of-filament"></a>

Then after some cleaning (it still needs a bit more though)<br /><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/126939770@N02/15096271410" title="cleaned-hobbed-bolt by Joe Norton, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3918/15096271410_954e4c4955_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="cleaned-hobbed-bolt"></a>

##4. As bad as it gets, resist the urge to drill.##
I fell for this. The heat creep had gotten so bad in my case that the filament coming out of the cold end was swollen and warped. It couldn't be pulled out. I eventually had to drill it out. Although I did an okay job driling it, the real problem with doing this - in the long run - is the *contamination risk*. 

I didn't realize at the time, but what happens when you drill into the extruder assembly, is that you are bound to accidentally nick up some of the structure around the filament you are drilling, and those fragments will end up in the liquid filament pool being pushed out your nozzle. The issue is that the 'structure' getting fragmented into your filament is likely aluminum (from the cold end) or PFTE tube (the white tube connecting the ceramic melting chamber, heat sinks, and cold end). 

The problem with those materials are probably obvious to you - they don't melt like PLA or ABS does! __PFTE can take ~400 degrees to melt!__ So trust me, while in practice it might be the fastest way to unclog your rig - resist the urge to drill, the contamination risk is just too high. Trust me!

##5. Don't go it alone. If you bought your 3D Printer, and didn't make it, then you have somebody to reach out to for support ##
In my case, my extruder problems got so bad that I couldn't get a single print going. I was stuck. This is when I reached out to the manufacturer of my 3D Printer, and very quickly they worked with me to get replacements and returns done for the nescessary parts (Thanks <a href="https://www.lulzbot.com/" target="_blank">Lulzbot</a>!).  

Remember, part of the reason you buy a 3D printer instead of building your own is because you want somebody available to help you troubleshoot your very expensive toy when it breaks down.
