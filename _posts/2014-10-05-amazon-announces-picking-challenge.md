Amazon is looking for a robot that can replace 'pickers' in their warehouses. With their slick warehouse robots created by Kiva Systems (bought by Amazon in 2009 for $775 Million), the bottleneck in their shipping and processing system appears to be the humans in the picking department. To get the ball rolling on the 'basic research' that needs to be done in the area, they have started a contest

Can you create an autonomous picking robot?
----------------------

__Here are the details of the contest:__  
_This competition will challenge entrants to build their own robot hardware and software that can attempt simplified versions of the general task of picking items from shelves. The robots will be presented with a stationary lightly populated inventory shelf and be asked to pick a subset of the products and put them on a table. The challenge combines object recognition, pose recognition, grasp planning, compliant manipulation, motion planning, task planning, task execution, and error detection and recovery. The robots will be scored by how many items are picked in a fixed amount of time, with $26,000 in prizes being awarded. Participants will be encouraged to share and disseminate their approach to improve future challenge results and industrial implementations._
