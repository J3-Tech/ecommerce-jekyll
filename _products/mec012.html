product_description: "Micro Limit Switches, also called Miniature Snap Action Switches, are simple little switches that work well in robotics projects as 'end-stops', indicating when an object pushes the roller lever and has reached some 'max' position. Switching happens reliably, and repeatably at the same position. When the contact surface is likely to move across the switch, then it is best to go with a 'roller' style switch like this one. This switch can be used both in 'normally open' or in 'normally closed' operation -- meaning you can use the switch to either completely interrupt a circuit, or merely send a signal."
