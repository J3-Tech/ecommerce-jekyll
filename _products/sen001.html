title: "HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor"
excerpt: "These ultrasonic sensors send out high-frequency (inaudible) pings in order to approximate distance from objects. Very useful, and very cost-effective for cases where you don't need high precision."

<!-- 1 This module performance is stable, measure the distance accurately. performance nearly the same as SRF05, SRF02 SRF05, SRF02 ultrasonic distance measuring module and other comparable. Module High precision, blind spots (2cm) super close.

<h3>How it works</h3>
(1) using the trigger input, send a high signal to at least 10us;  
<br />
(2) module automatically sends eight 40khz square wave, automatically detects whether a signal return;   
<br />
(3) a signal back, through the IO output a high electrical level, high electrical level duration is: the ultrasound time from launch to return. Test distance = (time of the high electrical level * speed of sound (340M / S)) / 2;
