<b>Nortbotics</b> was founded by Joe Norton, a robotics hobbyist and web developer. After spending years trying to further his understanding of robotics, but finding few resources available for young adults, he decided that he was going to be the person to fill that need. The future is robots, and somebody needs to help get everybody prepared for that future.

>Founded to bridge the robotics education gap
Joe felt like most companies focus on kits for kids, leaving anyone over the age of 15 feeling alienated when trying to get started in the field. Joe felt like the state of Robotics education can be represented by a canyon, with a huge chasm in the middle. On one side there are kids and complete beginners - on the other side there are engineers and professional roboticists. Unfortunately, there are very few places for people to go to work on the skills, and learn the things they need to, in order to get to the other side of the canyon. Joe thought there has got to be some resources, some guides, some projects, some kits, some website that is built for those trying to bridge that chasm. That's what <b>Nortbotics</b> was created to do. To fill the gap, and help more beginners make their way to the other side of the canyon - to the land of professional robotics.

>Human knowledge belongs to the world.

We release all schematics, 3d models, documentation, etc. on an open-source license. As an organization we are thoroughly committed to the libre robotics movement. We want to share the things we work on, allow others to re-create them, and make derivatives, even commercially. We use the [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). 

**Some people ask us 'Why do you give away things you can patent?'**  
We don't think intellectual property is a defensible concept. No one can tell you how you may or may not use your own property. The idea that someone can have a government mandated monopoly on a certain creation/process just because they thought of it first is downright laughable. Property rights make sense for 'scarce resources' - but not for intangible things like ideas, processes, digital goods, etc. That is why we do not patent our work and keep it locked away - barring humanity from re-creating what we did. Instead we share it.
